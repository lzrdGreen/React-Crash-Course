## Description

The React Crash Course starts with a focused JavaScript refresher that covers exactly what you need to excel in React development. It then guides you through 13 carefully crafted lessons with clear well-commented code, covering essential React principles from the basics to state management and API integration. The course culminates in a Capstone Project - a GitHub User Finder application - which goes beyond typical beginner projects by incorporating real-world API integration, state management, and dynamic content rendering.
